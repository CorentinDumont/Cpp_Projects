### Hangman_Pokemon: ####

Rules:
This is a hangman game for 2 players. The goal is to guess a word letter by letter by using a virtual keyboard.
When a player guess wrong 9 times, he loses his turn and get 9 points. Even if he can find the word, the player get as many points as he made mistakes.
The two players play one after the other several times, and when they end the game, the player who has the less points win.

Particularity:
The words to guess are pokemons' names in English, this is why the game is called Hangman_Pokemon.

Details:
The game (the interface) is in French. See 'Hangman_Pokemon_Interface1.png' and 'Hangman_Pokemon_Interface2.png' for some explanations in English.
Function's names in the source code are also written in French, but I wrote comments in English.
